## Grocery Store - Console application

This was our third major assignment at IT-HÃ¶gskolan, Java system development vocational school. 
It includes menus and interfaces for admin functions of a grocery store with a CSV and in-memory storage of products.
Also includes the ability to apply discounts and such.
